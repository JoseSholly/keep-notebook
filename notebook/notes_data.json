But amidst the chaos, there is a powerful tool that can bring clarity, confidence, and control: discipline.\n\nDiscipline is not just about self-control or restriction; it's about cultivating the ability to make intentional choices that align with your values and goals. It's about harnessing your inner strength to overcome obstacles, achieve success, and build resilience.\n\nWhen you practice discipline, you're not just building habits or following rules; you're developing a mindset that empowers you to take ownership of your life. You're learning to listen to your inner voice, trust your instincts, and make decisions that align with your true desires.\n\nDiscipline is not a destination; it's a journey. It's a process of growth, learning, and self-improvement. It requires patience, persistence, and self-awareness. But the rewards are immeasurable.\n\nWith discipline, you'll discover:\n\n1. **Clarity of purpose**: When you're disciplined, you'll have a clear sense of direction and purpose. You'll know what you want to achieve and be willing to work towards it.\n2. **Increased confidence**: As you develop discipline, you'll become more confident in your abilities and decisions. You'll trust yourself and your judgment.\n3. **Improved focus**: Discipline helps you stay focused on what's important, avoiding distractions and staying committed to your goals.\n4. **Resilience**: When faced with setbacks or challenges, discipline gives you the strength to bounce back, adapt, and learn from your mistakes.\n5. **Enhanced self-awareness**: Discipline helps you develop a greater understanding of yourself, your strengths, and your weaknesses.\n6. **Better relationships**: When you're disciplined in your personal life, you'll build stronger relationships built on trust, respect, and communication.\n7. **Increased productivity**: Discipline enables you to manage your time effectively, prioritize tasks, and achieve more in less time.\n8. **Greater sense of accomplishment**: When you're disciplined, you'll experience a sense of pride and fulfillment as you achieve your goals and make progress towards your dreams.\n\nBut discipline is not just about individual achievement; it's also about building a better world for ourselves and others. When we practice discipline in our personal lives, we become more responsible citizens, contributing members of society.\n\nIn conclusion, the power of discipline is a powerful force that can transform our lives in profound ways. It's not just about following rules or restrictions; it's about cultivating the strength, resilience, and confidence to live an authentic life that aligns with our values and goals.\n\nSo let us embrace the power of discipline as we navigate the challenges of life. Let us harness its strength to build a brighter future for ourselves and those around us.\n\nRemember: Discipline is not a limitation; it's a liberation from the noise of uncertainty to the clarity of purpose.", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-18T08:07:13.195Z", "updated": "2024-07-18T08:52:36.804Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "Love", "body": "Aurora, a free-spirited poet, lived in the whispering hills of Tuscany, where the sun dipped into the horizon and painted the sky with hues of saffron and amethyst.

His days are filled with the hum of the city, and his nights with the rhythm of his favorite jazz clubs.\r\n\r\nTheir paths cross in an unexpected way. Aurora's art gallery is hosting an exhibition in NYC, and Atlas stumbles upon it while exploring the city. He's immediately captivated by Aurora's vibrant paintings, which seem to dance across the walls like starlight on a moonless night. As he lingers, lost in her art, he feels an inexplicable connection to this mysterious woman he's never met.\r\n\r\nAurora, sensing his presence, turns around to find a stranger standing before her, eyes locked on her creations. Their gazes meet, and the air is filled with an unspoken understanding. They exchange words, but it's as if they're speaking a language only they can comprehend.\r\n\r\nAs the exhibition comes to a close, Atlas knows he must find a way to bridge the distance between them. He begins composing a song inspired by Aurora's art, pouring his heart onto the page like ink on paper. The melody whispers secrets only she can hear, and Aurora feels an ache in her chest, as if the notes are speaking directly to her soul.\r\n\r\nThe song becomes a sensation online, and Aurora discovers it while browsing through music platforms. She's mesmerized by the beauty of Atlas's composition and recognizes the thread that connects them – their love for creative expression.\r\n\r\nAs they begin exchanging messages, their words flow like a gentle stream. They share stories about their passions, their dreams, and their fears. With each passing day, their connection grows stronger, until they realize they're not just kindred spirits but soulmates.\r\n\r\nDespite the vast distance between them, they find ways to bridge the gap. Atlas sends Aurora packages filled with lyrics and melodies inspired by her art. Aurora creates paintings reflecting Atlas's songs. Their love becomes a symphony of emotions, echoing across oceans.\r\n\r\nOne fateful night, Atlas decides to take a chance and book a ticket to Paris. As he steps off the plane, he feels the familiar rhythm of his heartbeat quicken. He makes his way to Aurora's studio, his heart pounding with anticipation.\r\n\r\nAurora senses his presence before he arrives and opens the door to find Atlas standing before her. They embrace as if they've known each other forever.

Putin has held continuous positions as president or prime minister since 1999:[d] as prime minister from 1999 to 2000 and from 2008 to 2012, and as president from 2000 to 2008 and since 2012.[e][7] He is the longest-serving Russian or Soviet leader since Joseph Stalin.\r\n\r\nPutin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. In 1996, he moved to Moscow to join the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as the director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and then as secretary of the Security Council of Russia before being appointed prime minister in August 1999. Following Yeltsin's resignation, Putin became acting president and, in less than four months, was elected to his first term as president. He was reelected in 2004. Due to constitutional limitations of two consecutive presidential terms, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev. He returned to the presidency in 2012, following an election marked by allegations of fraud and protests, and was reelected in 2018.\r\n\r\nDuring Putin's initial presidential tenure, the Russian economy grew on average by seven percent per year,[8] driven by economic reforms and a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas.[9][10] Additionally, Putin led Russia in a conflict against Chechen separatists, reestablishing federal control over the region.[11][12] While serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw a military conflict with Georgia and enacted military and police reforms. In his third presidential term, Russia annexed Crimea and supported a war in eastern Ukraine through several military incursions, resulting in international sanctions and a financial crisis in Russia. He also ordered a military intervention in Syria to support his ally Bashar al-Assad during the Syrian civil war, ultimately securing permanent naval bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.[13][14][15]\r\n\r\nIn February 2022, during his fourth presidential term, Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which prompted international condemnation and led to expanded sanctions. In September 2022, he announced a partial mobilization and forcibly annexed four Ukrainian oblasts into Russia. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes[16] related to his alleged criminal responsibility for illegal child abductions during the war.[17] In April 2021, after a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments that included one allowing him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.[18][19] In June 2023, he survived the Wagner Group rebellion. In March 2024, he was reelected for another term.\r\n\r\nUnder Putin's rule, the Russian political system has been transformed into an authoritarian dictatorship.[20][21][22] His rule has been marked by endemic corruption and widespread human rights violations, including the imprisonment and suppression of political opponents, intimidation and censorship of independent media in Russia, and a lack of free and fair elections.[23][24][25] Putin's Russia has consistently received low scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, The Economist Democracy Index, Freedom House's Freedom in the World index, and the Reporters Without Borders Press Freedom Index.\r\n\r\nEarly life\r\nPutin was born on 7 October 1952 in Leningrad, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia),[26] the youngest of three children of Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (née Shelomova; 1911–1998). His grandfather, Spiridon Putin (1879–1965), was a personal cook to Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.[27][28] Putin's birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers: Albert, born in the 1930s, died in infancy, and Viktor, born in 1940, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany's forces in World War II.[29][30]\r\n\r\n\r\nPutin's father, Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin\r\n\r\nPutin's mother, Maria Ivanovna Shelomova\r\nPutin's mother was a factory worker, and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. During the early stage of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD.[31][32][33] Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942.[34] Putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.[35]", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-19T19:46:31.383Z", "updated": "2024-07-19T19:46:31.383Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 19, "fields": {"title": "Trump Border Report", "body": "Although Trump boasted during a speech in Alamo, Texas, just a week before he left office that “we reformed our immigration system and achieved the most secure southern border in U.S. history,” the number of apprehensions for illegal border crossings was higher during Trump’s presidency than either of Obama’s four-year terms.\r\n\r\nBut these statistics tell only part of the story. The number of apprehensions fluctuated wildly during Trump’s presidency, from a monthly low of 11,127 in April 2017 to a high of 132,859 in May 2019.\r\n\r\nAfter constant talk on the campaign trail about building a wall and cracking down on illegal immigration, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the immediate months after Trump’s inauguration — “what became known as the Trump Effect,” Jessica Bolter, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, told us. The monthly low of 11,127 in April 2017 is unmatched in Customs and Border Protection records going back to 2000.\r\n\r\nBut the numbers crept back up in late 2017 and early 2018. There was another small dip after the so-called zero tolerance policy was initiated in mid-2018, Bolter said. Trump administration policy required the Department of Homeland Security to refer all adults who illegally entered the U.S. for criminal prosecution. That resulted in children being separated from their parents, who entered the federal court system and were placed in detention centers for adults only. But after Trump signed an executive order ending the policy, apprehensions again rose, Bolter said. \r\n\r\nThe number of apprehensions peaked in mid-2019, and the year ended with the highest number of apprehensions since 2007. In response, Trump issued several policies to reduce immigration flows, including measures to restrict eligibility for asylum and return non-Mexican asylum seekers who cross the Southwest border to Mexico while their claims work their way through immigration courts (the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program). Correspondingly, apprehensions dropped steadily through the second half of 2019 and into 2020.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the pandemic hit, apprehensions dropped even more dramatically in April and May 2020. As a result of the pandemic, there was an increased restriction on mobility, not just in the U.S. but around the world, Bolter said.\r\n\r\nIn response to the pandemic, Trump put into place a series of policies aimed at blocking migration to the U.S., including one that allowed border patrol to quickly expel any illegal immigrants they stopped, without access to the appeals system.\r\n\r\nWhile the policy may have deterred families with children from crossing, it served as an incentive for single adults to attempt illegal crossings, multiple times if necessary, Bolter told us. And so there was an increase in apprehensions in the second half of 2020.\r\n\r\nTrump didn’t fulfill the signature promise of his 2016 campaign — to build a 1,000-mile-long wall along the Southwest border. Nonetheless, a substantial amount of fencing was constructed.\r\n\r\nIn total, 458 miles of “border wall system” was built during the Trump administration, according to a CBP status report on Jan. 22, 2021. Most of that, 373 miles of it, is replacement for primary or secondary fencing that was dilapidated or outdated. In addition, 52 miles of new primary wall and 33 miles of secondary wall were built in locations where there were no barriers before.\r\n\r\nSince the land border itself is 1,954 miles long, according to the US-Mexico International Boundary and Water Commission, the new fencing constructed under Trump covers just over 20% of the Southwest border. Together with what existed before Trump took office, there are now about 706 miles of barriers, about 36% of the total Southwest border.\r\n\r\nCorporate Profits\r\nAfter-tax corporate profits set new records in the first two years of Trump’s presidency — but declined slightly in 2019 and fell further still in 2020, when the pandemic forced businesses to close, some permanently. \r\n\r\nStill, after-tax corporate profits were higher when Trump left office than when he arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCorporate profits hit a record $1.98 trillion in 2018 (see line 45), up from the previous record of $1.88 trillion set in 2017. Profits dipped in 2019 ($1.95 trillion) and again in 2020 ($1.91 trillion).\r\n\r\nDespite the two-year decline, after-tax corporate profits were 8.5% higher last year than they were in 2016, the year before Trump’s inauguration.\r\n\r\nAn April study by economists at the Federal Reserve estimated that from March 2020 through February 2021 the “excess establishment exit” — that is, permanent closures beyond what would otherwise have been expected — was below 200,000 establishments. That implies “an exit rate about one-quarter to one-third above normal,” the study said. \r\n\r\nWhile many of those closures would involve small businesses that are not corporations, the figures give some indication of the economic impact of the pandemic.\r\n\r\nStock Market\r\nAfter a pandemic-induced plunge in stock prices in March 2020 ended a decade-long bull market, the stock market quickly recovered and set new record highs.  \r\n\r\nOn Jan. 19, 2021, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock average closed at 67.8% above where it had been the day before Trump was inaugurated in 2017. \r\n\r\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, made up of 30 large corporations, was up 56.7% during Trump’s time in office.\r\n\r\nAnd the NASDAQ composite index, made up of more than 3,000 companies including many in the technology sector, more than doubled under Trump — up 138.2% since he took office.\r\n\r\nThese gains came after sizable increases in the market under Obama, when the S&P rose 166% and the Dow Jones went up 138% over his eight years, after the 2007-2009 financial crisis.\r\n\r\nWages and Inflation\r\nDuring Trump’s four years in office, wages went up and inflation remained in check.\r\n\r\nCPI — The Consumer Price Index rose 7.6% under Trump — continuing a long period of low inflation that appears to be coming to an end under Biden, as supply chain problems and other factors drive up costs.\r\n\r\nThe CPI rose an average of 1.9% each year of the Trump presidency (measured as the 12-month change ending each January), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was about the same as the average under Obama (1.8%) and below the average of 2.4% during each of George W. Bush’s years.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, CPI was up 5.3% in August compared to a year ago. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said at a panel discussion in late September that he expected inflation pressures to continue into 2022.\r\n\r\nWages — Meanwhile, paychecks grew faster than prices during Trump’s tenure.\r\n\r\nThe average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in “real” (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 8.7% in Trump’s four years. Wages for rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers — who make up 81% of all private-sector workers — went up 9.8% under Trump.\r\n\r\nThe gains extended a trend that started after the 2007-2009 recession. During the Obama years, real weekly earnings rose 4.2% for all workers, and 4% for rank-and-file.\r\n\r\nConsumer Sentiment\r\nConsumer confidence in the economy initially rose under Trump, who promised during the campaign to “make our economy grow again.” But, like other economic measures, it fell during the pandemic. \r\n\r\nThe University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers monthly index was 87.2 in October 2016, a month before the 2016 presidential election, and 98.5 in January 2017, when Trump took office. Under Trump, the consumer confidence rate reached 100 or more five times — a level that it hadn’t reached during Obama’s eight years or any of the prior four years during Bush’s second term. \r\n\r\nThe rate under Trump peaked at 101.4 in March 2018 — the highest it had been since January 2004. It was at 101 in February 2020, a month before the pandemic shut down large parts of the economy. From there, the rate fell 11.9 points in March 2020 and plunged another 17.3 points in April 2020, when the rate dropped to 71.8 — its lowest level during the Trump presidency.   \r\n\r\nWhen Trump left office, the preliminary figure for January 2021 was 79 — 8.2 points lower than where it was in October 2016, just before Trump was elected, and 19.5 points lower than where it stood when he took office in January 2017. \r\n\r\nHome Prices\r\nHome prices set annual records in each of Trump’s four years in office.\r\n\r\nThe national median price of an existing, single-family home was $300,200 last year, according to seasonally adjusted annual sales figures from the National Association of Realtors. That’s 27.5% higher than it was in 2016, when the median price was $235,500. \r\n\r\nMuch of the rise has taken place since the pandemic hit. Existing single-family home prices jumped 12.9% from February 2020 to January 2021. Experts attribute the higher prices to high demand, supply shortages and record-low mortgage rates.  \r\n\r\nThe Realtors’ figures reflect raw sales prices without accounting for inflation. But home prices far outstripped inflation during Trump’s tenure. The Consumer Price Index rose only 7.6% during that same period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHomeownership\r\nThe percentage of Americans who own their homes continued to recover under Trump, but it has yet to return to the highs of 2004.\r\n\r\nThe homeownership rate, which the Census Bureau measures as the percentage of housing units that are owner-occupied, peaked at 69.2% for two quarters in 2004. From there, the rate steadily fell for more than a decade, and tied for the lowest on record in the second quarter of 2016 at 62.9%. (Census Bureau homeownership rates date to 1965, when the rate was 62.9% for the first nine months of that year.)\r\n\r\nThe rate recovered 0.8 points in Obama’s last six months, and the trend generally continued over the last four years. In Trump’s last quarter in office, the homeownership rate reached 65.8% — 2.1 points higher than it was when he took office. \r\n\r\nThe Census Bureau, however, urged data users to “exercise caution when comparing the second, third, and fourth quarter 2020 estimates” to previous quarters because of the pandemic and changes in data collection caused by the pandemic. Census said it suspended in-person data collection in March 2020, because of the spread of the coronavirus.", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-21T14:27:23.498Z", "updated": "2024-07-21T14:27:23.498Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 20, "fields": {"title": "Cole Plamer", "body": "Cole Jermaine Palmer (born 6 May 2002) is an English professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Premier League club Chelsea and the England national team. He is considered one of the best young players in Europe.[2][3]\r\n\r\nAn academy graduate of Manchester City, Palmer made his senior debut for the club in 2020, and was later part of their squad that won a continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League in 2023. He signed for Chelsea in 2023 for a fee of £40 million. That season, he scored 22 goals and assisted 17,[4] earning him the club's Player of the Season as well as Premier League Young Player of the Season.\r\n\r\nPalmer has represented England across various youth levels, including winning the 2023 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, before making his senior debut in the same year.\r\n\r\nEarly and personal life\r\nCole Jermaine Palmer[5] was born on 6 May 2002[6] in Wythenshawe, Manchester.[7] He grew up in Wythenshawe with one sister, raised by a dental engineer father and a dyslexia assessor mother.[8] Palmer's father played Sunday league football for nearly two decades, and Palmer regularly watched him.[8] Palmer was privately educated at St Bede's College in partnership with Manchester City Academy.[9]\r\n\r\nPalmer is of Afro-Kittitian descent on his father's side of the family.[10] His grandfather emigrated in 1960, while his great-grandparents were part of the Windrush generation, migrating five years earlier.[8] Palmer emblazoned his boots with the flag of England and the flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis.[8]\r\n\r\nClub career\r\nEarly career\r\n\r\nPalmer in 2016\r\nDespite being a Manchester United fan,[8] Palmer joined Manchester City at under-eight level and progressed through the Academy age groups before captaining the under-18s during the 2019–20 season.[11] He had faced concerns from the age of 14 that his physique was too slight for professional football, and academy coaches wanted to release him at 16, but academy director Jason Wilcox rejected their decision.[8]\r\n\r\nManchester City\r\nOn 30 September 2020, Palmer made his first-team debut for City in a 3–0 away win over Burnley in the fourth round of the EFL Cup.[12] He scored his first goal on 21 September 2021 in a 6–1 home win over League One team Wycombe Wanderers in the EFL Cup.[13] On 16 October, Palmer made an appearance in the Premier League against Burnley, and found himself playing and scoring a hat-trick for City's under-23 side that same night.[14] On 19 October, Palmer scored his first UEFA Champions League goal in a 5–1 away win over Club Brugge.[15] On 7 January 2022, Palmer scored on his FA Cup debut in a 4–1 away win over League Two team Swindon Town.[16]\r\n\r\nOn 6 August 2023, Palmer scored the first goal in the 2023 FA Community Shield against Arsenal, after coming on for Erling Haaland as a second-half substitute.[17] However, Arsenal scored in stoppage time and eventually won the match in a penalty shoot-out.[18] Ten days later, Palmer scored his final goal for Manchester City, which was an equaliser in the 2023 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, which Manchester City won 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out after the match finished 1–1.[19]\r\n\r\nChelsea\r\nOn 1 September, Palmer signed for Premier League club Chelsea on a seven-year contract, with the option of a further year.[20][21] The transfer fee was reported to be an initial £40 million, potentially rising by £2.5 million in add-ons.[21] He made his debut the following day as a 62nd-minute substitute in a 1–0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest.[22] On 7 October, Palmer scored his first goal for Chelsea, from a penalty kick, while also providing the assist for Nicolas Jackson's goal in a 4–1 away victory over Burnley.[23] On 6 November, Palmer registered a goal and an assist in a 4–1 away win at London rivals Tottenham Hotspur.[24] Six days later, Palmer scored a stoppage-time penalty against former club Manchester City, as the two teams played out a 4–4 draw at Stamford Bridge.[25]\r\n\r\nIn Chelsea's final match of 2023, away to Luton Town, Palmer scored twice for the first time professionally, while also assisting Noni Madueke's goal, as Chelsea won 3–2.[26] As a result of his performances during December, which included four goals and two assists, Palmer was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award, and his second goal against Luton Town was nominated for Premier League Goal of the Month.[27][28] On 23 January 2024, Palmer scored another brace, this time in the EFL Cup semi-finals, as Chelsea defeated Middlesbrough 6–1 (6–2 on aggregate) to advance to the final at Wembley Stadium.[29] He scored his tenth league goal of the season on 4 February, making him the first Chelsea player aged 21 or under to score 10 Premier League goals in a season, however, this ended in a 4–2 home defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers.[30] On 29 February, Palmer was named the Men's Young Player of the Year at the 2024 London Football Awards.[31][32] By assisting Axel Disasi's goal against Brentford on 2 March, Palmer became the Chelsea player with the most goal contributions in a season aged 21 or younger, overtaking Arjen Robben's tally of 16 contributions in 2004–05.[33][34]\r\n\r\nOn 4 April, Palmer was nominated for the Premier League Player of the Month award a second time after more impressive displays throughout March that saw him score three goals and provide two assists.[35] Later that day, he scored his first career hat-trick, which included two goals scored deep into added time to complete Chelsea's comeback in a 4–3 home victory against Manchester United. By doing so, Palmer became the 200th different player in Premier League history to score a hat-trick, as well as the third youngest to do so in a match against Manchester United.[36] Palmer's performance in this match enabled him to become the third ever recipient of the Premier League Game Changer of the Season award.[37] On 15 April, Palmer scored his second career hat-trick against Everton in a 6–0 home win, finishing the match with 4 goals and thus became the 31st Premier League player to score 4 or more goals in a league game,[38][39] and the first Chelsea player to score two Premier League hat-tricks for the club in a season.[40][better source needed] Furthermore, he became the third player in the club's history to score at least 20 goals in his debut season, following Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in 2000–01 and Diego Costa in 2014–15.[41]\r\n\r\nOn 5 May, Palmer scored during a 5–0 home victory against West Ham United, becoming only the third player in Premier League history aged 21 or younger to contribute to 30 or more goals in a single season.[42] Palmer was then named Chelsea Players' Player of the Season as well as Chelsea Player of the Season, voted for by supporters,[43] as well as being awarded the Premier League Player of the Month award for April 2024 and the Premier League Goal of the Month award for his first goal against Everton, becoming the first player in Chelsea history and the fifth player overall to win the Player of the Month and Goal of the Month awards in the same month.[44][45] On 11 May, Palmer made his 50th overall Premier League appearance, marking the occasion with an assist in a 3–2 away win at Nottingham Forest. By doing so, Palmer became the 13th player in Premier League history to score 20 or more goals and provide 10 or more assists in the same season.[46]\r\n\r\nPalmer finished the season with a total of 27 goals and 15 assists across all competitions; he had the most goal involvements (33: 22 goals, 11 assists) of any other player in the 2023–24 Premier League season. He won the Premier League Young Player of the Season and PFA Fans' Player of the Year awards for his outstanding first season at Chelsea while also being nominated for the Premier League Player of the Season and the FWA Footballer of the Year awards.[47][48][49][50][51] His Goal of the Month winning strike against Everton in April was nominated for Premier League Goal of the Season.[52]", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-25T10:12:25.454Z", "updated": "2024-07-25T10:12:25.454Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 21, "fields": {"title": "sss", "body": "sss", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-25T10:49:52.130Z", "updated": "2024-07-25T10:49:52.130Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 22, "fields": {"title": "Home", "body": "New Name", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-25T12:06:26.374Z", "updated": "2024-07-25T12:06:26.374Z"}}, {"model": "notes.note", "pk": 23, "fields": {"title": "Django", "body": "SRT", "label": null, "archived": false, "pinned": false, "created": "2024-07-25T12:07:17.318Z", "updated": "2024-07-25T12:07:17.319Z"}}]
